## β Beta

#### 2025-02-02 — 0.4.2

-   Fixed edge case issue where no using directives or namespace exists in a file with a class.

#### 2025-02-02 — 0.4.1

-   Minor improvements and fixes to parsing symbols, mostly relating to primary constructors.

#### 2025-02-01 — 0.4.0

-   **IN PREVIEW:** Feature to remove unused packages references (NuGet) of one or more projects in a solution. This also removes unused `using` directives and, now with this version, ability to _sharpen_ files.
-   Added setting (`csharpen.sharpenFilesWhenRemovingUnusedReferences`) to indicate whether to _sharpen_ files while removing unused package references. Disabled by default.
-   Added progress window when removing unused package references.
-   Added ability to cancel the process of removing unused package references.
-   Added ability for user to address issues when removing unused package references. User may continue the process or abort.
-   Added support for a workspace settings file to have per-workspace settings. This file can be generated by the command "Create CSharpen workspace settings file..." (`kokoabim.csharpen.create-workspace-settings-file`).
-   Added support for regex patterns in the `csharpen.doNotRemoveThesePackageReferences` setting.
-   Other minor improvements and fixes.

#### 2025-01-31 — 0.3.0

-   **IN PREVIEW** (i.e. can have issues though can undo): Added feature to remove unused packages references (NuGet) of one or more projects in a solution. This also removes unused `using` directives. (Command: `Remove Unused References Of Project...`)
    -   **KNOWN ISSUE:** There is a possibility that _used_ `using` directives are incorrectly removed. If so, since all files are opened and modified, it can be undone.
    -   Added new setting (`csharpen.doNotRemoveThesePackageReferences`) to indicate what package names to skip when removing unused package references, which has a default value. A conditional removal can be indicated by appending a semicolon (`;`) and another package reference name. If the second package reference exists, then the primary package reference will not be removed.
        -   Example: `foo;bar` will remove `foo` only if `bar` does _not_ exist. There are some package references that are not referenced in code but tooling requires them to be present.
    -   Added new setting (`csharpen.delayBeforeRemovingUnusedUsingDirectives`) to indicate delay in milliseconds before detecting and removing unused `using` directives (to help with detecting them), which has a default value.
-   Added ability to select one or more projects when sharpening all files in a project.
-   Fixed issue with parsing non-code blocks (e.g. comments) prior to symbols.

#### 2025-01-24 — 0.2.1

-   Fixed issue with properly structuring parent-to-child hierarchy of symbols.

#### 2025-01-19 — 0.2.0

-   Added ability to sharpen all files in a project.
-   Added ability to output file diagnostics for all files in a project.

#### 2025-01-18 — 0.1.0

-   Added feature to enforce use of file-scoped namespaces on _sharpen_. This can be toggle in settings.
-   Upgraded to beta since there has been a lot of recent changes and fixes, and I use it heavily in my daily work and find it quite stable (and useful).

## ⍺ Alpha

#### 2025-01-18 — 0.0.13

-   Fixed issue when detecting and creating non-code blocks (e.g. comments). It was too aggressive and behavior would be that comments from down below would be pulled up to top symbols. Using a primary constructor could induce this.

-   Fixed issue with having multiple attributes.
